We had discussed how the algorithm works during one of our meetings. So strictly speaking you do not
need any secondary literature, as long as you have understood what i tried to explain.

All you need for the big algorithm is an implementation of the Orbit Algorithm and as far as I know you
have one. Here are the orbit algorithmâ€™s inputs and outputs:
INPUT: a list of permutations P and a number say i not fixed by P.
OUTPUT:a list of number, the Orbit of i under the list of permutations P,
and a list of permutations S that fix i and
generate the stabilizer of i in the group generated by the list of permutations P.

Big Algorithm:
Input: a list of permutations P.

You choose  a number i not fixed by P.
Then you compute the orbit  of that  number i  under  P,  that means you call the Orbit algorithm
with the list P and the number i.

The Orbit algorithm returns a new list of permutations  S.
You choose a number j that is not fixed by S,
You call the Orbit algorithm with S and j.
it returns a list of permutations T.
You choose a number k not fixed by T.
etc.
